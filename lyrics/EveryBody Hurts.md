Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me?
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
Hold on, on to me
Now I see
Now I see
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La-di-da-di-da, it's okay
It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone, I can't breathe
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening
Now I see (now I see)
Now I see (ooh)
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La-di-da-di-da, it's okay
La-la-la-la-la


So many questions, so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
Wish I could turn back the time
I wonder why
Everybody hurts some days (some days)
Everybody hurts some days (some days)
Everybody hurts some days (some days)
It's okay to be afraid (afraid)
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La-di-da-di-da, it's okay
La-la-la-la-la, that's okay
Everybody hurts some days (some days)
It's okay to be afraid (afraid)
Everybody hurts some days, yeah, we all feel pain (it's okay)
Everybody feels this way, but it'll be okay (some days)
Can't somebody take me away to a better place?
Everybody feels this way
It's okay
La-di-da-di-da, it's okay
La-la-la-la-la, it's okay
La-di-da-di-da, it's okay
La-la-la-la-la, it's okay
