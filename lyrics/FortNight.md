I was supposed to be   sent away But    they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning    alcoholic [ˌælkəˈhɒlɪk] 酗酒 Til nobody   noticed my new aesthetic [esˈθetɪk] 审美
All of this to say     I hope you're okay   But you're the reason
And no one   here's to blame 责备
But what about  your quiet treason? 叛逆
And for a fortnight there  We were forever  Run into you sometimes Ask about 
the weather Now you're in my backyard Turned into  good neighbors [ˈneɪbəz] 邻居
Your wife waters flowers I want to kill her.

All my mornings are   Mondays  Stuck in an   endless February [ˈfebrueri]
I took the miracle    move-on-drug The       effects[ɪˈfekts]  were temporary[ˈtempəreri] 短期的 雇佣工
And I love you
It's ruining my life
(I love you, it's ruining my life)
I touched you
For only a fortnight
(I touched you)
But I touched you

And for a fortnight there  We were forever  Run into you sometimes Ask about 
the weather Now you're in my backyard Turned into  good neighbors [ˈneɪbəz] 邻居
Your wife waters flowers I want to kill her.

And for a fortnight there
We were together
Run into you sometimes
Comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox
Turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating
I want to kill him.

I love you
It's ruining my life
(I love you, it's ruining my life)
I touched you for only a fortnight
(I touched you)
I touched you
I love you
It's ruining my life [ˈruːɪnɪŋ] 
(I love you, it's ruining my life)
I touched you for only a fortnight
(I touched you)
I touched you

Thought of calling ya
But you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida
Buy the car you want
But it won't start up
Til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya
But you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida
Buy the car you want
But it won't start up
Til I touch, touch, touch you
