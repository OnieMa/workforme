[kɔːˈniːljə] [striːt]

We were in the backseat
装康                     
Drunk-on something    stronger Than the drinks in the bar
[drʌŋk]

"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
      [ˈkæʒuəli] 偶然

We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blank sas we go
 安 zei fz                             [ˈærəʊhed] 箭头
As if the streetlights   pointed in an arrowhead   Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the  kind of heartbreak  time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystiﬁed [ˈmɪstɪfaɪd] by   how This city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terriﬁed of    if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

        [flʌŋ] 
Windows ﬂung right open             
[ˈɔːtəm]                             [this]
Autumn air,  jacket round my should ers is yours
We bless the rains   on Cornelia Street
Memorise the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags left ,  Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called
Showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the  
tunnel Sat  on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystiﬁed by how
This city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


You hold my hand    on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
[ˈbeəfʊt]
Barefoot in the kitchen
[ˈseɪkrɪd] 
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion  [rɪˈlɪdʒən]
Listen...
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again

And baby, I get mystiﬁed by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (yeah)
