I never trust a narcissist [/ˈnɑːsɪsɪst/] `自我陶醉者`
But they love me
So I play'em like a violin [/vaɪə'lɪn/] `小提琴`
      makilek
And I make it look,  oh, so easy
'Cause-for every lie-I tell them
They tell me three
This=is how the world works
Now all he  thinks-about is me


I can feel the  flames `火焰`-on my skin
Crimson [/ˈkrɪmzn/] `深红的` red       paint[/peɪnt/] `油漆 化妆品` on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe `亏欠` him nothing 
I don't regret [/rɪˈɡret/] `遗憾 抱歉` it one bit `少量 有点`, 'cause he had it comin'
They say I did something bad Then 
why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad Then 
why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over, and over, and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good



I never trust a playboy
But they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming
What I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over, and over, and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good? (So good)
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over, and over, and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
Oh, they say I did something bad (they say I did something bad)
Then why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good
