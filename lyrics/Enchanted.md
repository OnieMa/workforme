There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
         [ˌɪnsɪnˈserəti] 伪善
Walls of insincerity
                  歪肯c  [ˈveɪkənsi] 空缺
Shifting eyes and vacancy
[ˈvænɪʃt] 销声匿迹 无影无踪 消失了
Vanished when I  saw your face
昂la       塞ei
All I can say is   it was  enchanting to meet you

          [ˈwɪspəd] 私语 
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
[əˈkrɒs]              c路安t[ˌsɪluˈet] 暗色轮廓;剪影;侧影
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks Like 
passing notes in secrecy [ˈsiːkrəsi] n.秘密
And it  was enchanting to meet you
All I can say  is I was enchanted to meet you



This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
    [ˈwʌndəˌstrʌk] 大吃一惊  [ˈblʌʃɪŋ]鲜红;脸红;害羞
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you



    [ˈlɪŋɡərɪŋ]       [kept] 
The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
           [ˈpeɪsɪŋ] 步调 踱步
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was    enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
