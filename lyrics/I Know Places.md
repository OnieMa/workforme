"I Know Places"

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)





Each time you failed
You just called me your girl
你以为这是爱情 起死回生的药
You know
你什么都很潮 但这种调调
Woah Woah
你耍的绝招 其实很搞笑
听过了 九百次的梗
已变成骚扰
And you know what
我亲爱的 你大事不妙
Woah Woah
Mirror mirror on the wall
I don't need you any more
I'm the smartest of them all
G R L S My girl
You cast a spell    
You made me melt
I'm back from hell
I'm not your girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
My girl
Na na na
All of my girls what
All of my girls what
刮风打雷 没有谁
Girls like us we ain't afraid
如果爱谁 命就给谁
看起来 很凄美
想起来 太谦卑
Mirror mirror on the wall
I don't need you any more
I know I'm the smartest of them all
Mirror mirror on the wall
Boys are stupid Let them fall
We'll still shine like disco ball
You cast a spell
You made me melt
I'm back from hell
I'm not your girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
My girl
Na na na
All of my girls what
All of my girls what
My girl
My girl
I am my own girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
My girl
Na na na
All of my girls what
I am my own girl
