Each time you failed
You just called me your girl
你以为这是爱情 起死回生的药
You know
你什么都很潮 但这种调调
Woah Woah
你耍的绝招 其实很搞笑
听过了 九百次的梗
已变成骚扰
And you know what
我亲爱的 你大事不妙
Woah Woah
Mirror mirror on the wall
I don't need you any more
I'm the smartest of them all
G R L S My girl
You cast a spell
You made me melt
I'm back from hell
I'm not your girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
My girl
Na na na
All of my girls what
All of my girls what
刮风打雷 没有谁
Girls like us we ain't afraid
如果爱谁 命就给谁
看起来 很凄美
想起来 太谦卑
Mirror mirror on the wall
I don't need you any more
I know I'm the smartest of them all
Mirror mirror on the wall
Boys are stupid Let them fall
卫 丝dei sha拉k 迪斯科棒
We'll still shine like disco ball
You cast a spell
You made me melt
I'm back from hell
I'm not your girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
My girl
Na na na
All of my girls what
All of my girls what
My girl
My girl
I am my own girl
Hey I wanna rule my world
I don't wanna be your girl
And I just wanna be myself
I'm not your girl
I'm not your girl
My girl
Na na na
All of my girls what
I am my own girl [4]
