"Karma"

You're talking shit   for the hell of it
e dei tei to 比 踹l   but you  ruan len 文t
[əˈdɪktɪd]  [bɪˈtreɪəl]          [ˈreləvənt]
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant

You're terrified to look down

'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side   of the street clean 
You wouldn't know    what I mean


'Cause karma is my boyfriend    
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
昂tiu 安卫 也san-for  you it's not
[ɑːnt]       [ˈenvi əs]
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
[ˈpɜːrɪŋ]     
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
[ˈflesɪŋ]挠曲   [ˈɡɒddæm]该死的  [ˈækrəbæt] 杂技演员
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
             [vaɪb] 感应 传递
Me and karma vibe like that

My pennies made   your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
                    [  先   di    ]
Don't you know that cash  ain't the only price?
It's coming back  around

And I keep my side     of the street clean
You wouldn't know      what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Ask me what I  learned from all those years
Ask me what I   earned from all those tears
Ask me why   so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
[karma  son  you  san  likea bounty hunter]  
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna    track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like just-ice, karma is a queen
Karma takes   all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma's a relaxing thought
